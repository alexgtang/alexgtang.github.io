# Clock Visualization for COMSW4995: Intro to Data Visualization

## Description
This visualization represents time using a block-based layout, where each block corresponds to a unit of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, or hours). The color of each block is determined by scaling the time into hexadecimal (HEX) color values, creating a dynamic and visually appealing representation of time.
